# FinHeartBel
FinHeartBel is brought to you by an international collaboration between Finnish and Belgian Students.
Healthcare is the main focus from our project. 
We provide our users a simple ECG (electrocardiogram), one of the simplest and oldest cardiac investigations available, and will notify them when thresholds are exceeded.
ECGs provide a wealth of useful information and remains an essential part of the assessment of cardiac patients.

## Getting Started
We use an node-enviroment for the serving of the wesite. We used Angular-Cli to generate the projectstructure.

### Prerequisites
Install the latest version of NodeJS from [node.org](https://nodejs.org) and for Angular-cli

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
cd website/
npm install
```
### serving the webapp

navigate to the src directory in website/ and run

```
ng serve
```

or with an diffrent portnumber than 4200

```
ng serve -p 3500
```


## Built With

* [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) - The web framework used
* [JAVA SPRING framework](https://spring.io/) - Server framework used
